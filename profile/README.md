## Policy for contribution
All commits within a repository for a "sensitive" project MUST be verified with a signature. Sensitive projects include things like FluxStore, as it comes with deep system access through the use of root-level commands, any SHDC Library, as it is important infrastructure, and any webpages associated with the domain envopen.org and its subdomains as it represetns our company and community. Other contributions to non critical projects (OddOrEven for example) Still require review, but need not be signed, however verified commits are greatly appeciated as it helps us verify that it is you contributing. 

## Out next steps
- Localisation for all projects (Community sourced)
- Ensuring proper standard compliance for ALL apps
- Linux package manager repositories (Apt, etc)
- winget repository
- Standardised installer files
