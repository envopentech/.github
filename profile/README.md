We are FED UP with the amount of stupid fees, and piles of eco-destructive ewaste.
This is where we come to help

### What are we doing
As you can see, there really isn't much here. This is because the operation has largly been e-waste recycling (Harvesting useful components, ensuring scraps go to proper places, and repairing/reselling/re-using where possible. But fear not! Proper projects will come soon.
