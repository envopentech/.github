Tena koe.
We are Env Open Technologies. A group dedicated to open-source libraries and software

## Our mission
Todays tech industry is full of proprietary, often subscription based (SaaS) software. And hard to repair hardware.
We are FED UP with the amount of stupid fees, and piles of eco-destructive ewaste.
This is where we come to help

### What are we doing
As you can see, there really isn't much here. This is because the operation has largly been e-waste recycling (Harvesting useful components, ensuring scraps go to proper places, and repairing/reselling/re-using where possible. But fear not! Proper projects will come soon.

## Join the group
It's free, allows you to keep your own donation links, publish to your private git account, and publish **ONE TIME** premium versions of your software (Provided the free version is still fully usable, and doesn't contain paywalls, but rather a fleshed out product where the pro version has benifits, but is not needed to get the job done

### The catch:
Include a crypto dono link for us on every repo under this org, and publish or provide a major update/overhaul to at least 1 repo per year. That's it. No cuts, no fees, no "You can only publish under us and have no credit" just mention us, link to us, and contribute to us.
